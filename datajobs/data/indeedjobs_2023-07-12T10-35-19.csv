 <p><b>Description</b></p>
 <p></p>
 <div>
   IFC—a member of the World Bank Group—is the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets. We work in more than 100 countries, using our capital, expertise, and influence to create markets and opportunities in developing countries. In fiscal year 2022, IFC committed a record $32.8 billion to private companies and financial institutions in developing countries, leveraging the power of the private sector to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity as economies grapple with the impacts of global compounding crises. For more information, visit www.ifc.org.
 </div>
 <p> The IFC 3.0 strategy aims to stimulate more investment activity across emerging markets, especially in Low Income Countries (LICs) and Fragile and Conflict affected States (FCS). This strategy aims to create new opportunities for private investments in riskier markets and sectors by proactively working “upstream” to create, deepen, and expand markets and design and develop potential investment projects. Achieving these growth and impact ambitions at scale requires a different approach to business development, deal sourcing, and client support that relies on 1) a broader product offering to engage earlier in the project cycle and secure opportunities; 2) a greater focus on preparing clients in nascent markets and sectors for investment; 3) a greater focus on value addition and risk management of portfolio investment clients to enhance their performance; and 4) a longer time horizon and a more patient, longer-term perspective.</p>
 <p> To support this approach, IFC is seeking an Operations Officer (OO) specializing in Financial infrastructure solutions and digital tools particularly in credit information and movable assets-based lending to support strategic priorities including but not limited to Climate Finance, MSME Inclusion, Food Security/Agri finance, Gender Finance, among others, for the FIG department of the Africa region. The OO is expected to support efforts to enable investment opportunities, enhance investment outcomes, and improve investment conditions– critical activities for the corporation to deliver on its ambitious strategy. The mix of these varied activities should be calibrated to meet the development needs of the market and contribute to IFC’s growth and impact objectives.The OO will be based in Johannesburg, South Africa and is expected to frequently visit (travel permitting) other offices where their team and clients are based.They will report to the Practice Group Lead, Financial Infrastructure, FIG Africa Upstream and Advisory. They will work in partnership with other practices within FIG Africa Upstream and advisory, keep close communication with Investment Officers to help identify investment opportunities.</p>
 <p><b><br> Roles and Responsibilities:</b></p>
 <p> IFC’s FIG Advisory Services aims to deliver innovative solutions to support target clients’ objectives to expand and grow their business, in line with IFC’s country strategies to address development challenges. The OO will be responsible to lead projects with primary emphasis on Credit Infrastructure, including the introduction of innovative data analytics tools, alternative data and scoring methodologies to drive MSME inclusion, and when relevant, also contribute to address the challenges in other priority areas such as Agri finance, Climate Finance, Housing, DFS, Risk Management and Gender Finance.</p>
 <p> The OO should have demonstrated experience in structuring, negotiating, and implementing successful technical assistance programs for the financial industry, private sector service providers and regulators; and an ability to clearly communicate and present the deliverables to senior stakeholders. The OO would play an instrumental role in helping FIG Upstream and Advisory deliver its targets, especially those related to effective project delivery and management and contributing to the team’s knowledge management initiatives.</p>

 <p><b>Description</b></p>
 <p></p>
 <div>
   IFC—a member of the World Bank Group—is the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets. We work in more than 100 countries, using our capital, expertise, and influence to create markets and opportunities in developing countries. In fiscal year 2022, IFC committed a record $32.8 billion to private companies and financial institutions in developing countries, leveraging the power of the private sector to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity as economies grapple with the impacts of global compounding crises. For more information, visit www.ifc.org.
 </div>
 <p> The IFC 3.0 strategy aims to stimulate more investment activity across emerging markets, especially in Low Income Countries (LICs) and Fragile and Conflict affected States (FCS). This strategy aims to create new opportunities for private investments in riskier markets and sectors by proactively working “upstream” to create, deepen, and expand markets and design and develop potential investment projects. Achieving these growth and impact ambitions at scale requires a different approach to business development, deal sourcing, and client support that relies on 1) a broader product offering to engage earlier in the project cycle and secure opportunities; 2) a greater focus on preparing clients in nascent markets and sectors for investment; 3) a greater focus on value addition and risk management of portfolio investment clients to enhance their performance; and 4) a longer time horizon and a more patient, longer-term perspective.</p>
 <p> To support this approach, IFC is seeking an Operations Officer (OO) specializing in Financial infrastructure solutions and digital tools particularly in credit information and movable assets-based lending to support strategic priorities including but not limited to Climate Finance, MSME Inclusion, Food Security/Agri finance, Gender Finance, among others, for the FIG department of the Africa region. The OO is expected to support efforts to enable investment opportunities, enhance investment outcomes, and improve investment conditions– critical activities for the corporation to deliver on its ambitious strategy. The mix of these varied activities should be calibrated to meet the development needs of the market and contribute to IFC’s growth and impact objectives.The OO will be based in Johannesburg, South Africa and is expected to frequently visit (travel permitting) other offices where their team and clients are based.They will report to the Practice Group Lead, Financial Infrastructure, FIG Africa Upstream and Advisory. They will work in partnership with other practices within FIG Africa Upstream and advisory, keep close communication with Investment Officers to help identify investment opportunities.</p>
 <p><b><br> Roles and Responsibilities:</b></p>
 <p> IFC’s FIG Advisory Services aims to deliver innovative solutions to support target clients’ objectives to expand and grow their business, in line with IFC’s country strategies to address development challenges. The OO will be responsible to lead projects with primary emphasis on Credit Infrastructure, including the introduction of innovative data analytics tools, alternative data and scoring methodologies to drive MSME inclusion, and when relevant, also contribute to address the challenges in other priority areas such as Agri finance, Climate Finance, Housing, DFS, Risk Management and Gender Finance.</p>
 <p> The OO should have demonstrated experience in structuring, negotiating, and implementing successful technical assistance programs for the financial industry, private sector service providers and regulators; and an ability to clearly communicate and present the deliverables to senior stakeholders.

      </div>
      <div>
       <b>WHO WE ARE</b> 
       <p>We're an innovative technology company with strong ties to the financial industry. Innovating bank interoperability since 1972, supporting the growth of the South African Economy and individuals across the continent, is what we excel at. Continuously striving for financial inclusion and providing everyone with access to the digital economy enabling them to do more, get more and benefit from financial inclusion so that they can give more.</p> 
      </div>
      <div>
       <b>WHAT WE DO</b>

      </div>
      <div>

BankservAfrica have a high AQ and it is this quality that has driven our business to continuously innovate and evolve, building capability and capacity to include more, enabling greater access to the country’s financial landscape.</p> 
      </div>
      <div>
       <b>WHERE WE'RE GOING</b> 
       <p>The payments landscape is being modernised globally and, therefore, ours is an exciting industry to be part of. New technologies are the main thrust driving this change. Technology enables the possibilities, and people’s ingenuity creates opportunities.</p>

      <p>As an enabler our future plans are orchestrated around assembling a central payments environment that actively seeks and acquires strategic partners to enable service extensions. The core of our Financial Services Platform is a fully interoperable, cloud-ready composite platform delivering real-time value transfer and settlement, enhanced by a range of value-added services.

        <li>Personalised user experiences, with standardised platform experiences being the norm</li>

       <p>Doing more will be realised through our creation of platform extension partners who will benefit from our standardised API capability which they in turn can offer to their clients, giving more. We aim to include new Market Actors through our value chain extension which will allow 'pass-through' connection in those cases where an existing actor passes services through a new actor enabling them to give more to the ecosystem without compromising the security or the role of the heavily regulated financial institutions.</p>

 <p><b> ABOUT THE CENTRE OF DIGITAL EXCELLENCE TEAM:</b></p> 
 <p> The Centre of Digital Excellence Team (C0DE) focuses on technology innovation and the opportunities this provides for improving the development potential of African Societies, as well as managing the risks inherent in an increasingly digital world.</p> 
 <p> The digital economy is rewiring the way we live, work, and interact. This digital transformation is a generation-defining revolution that can change Africa's narrative. But it also comes with significant risk. We work to create responsible solutions that are awake to both tremendous opportunities and the unprecedented risks.</p> 
 <p> Our work is focused on three areas:</p> 
 <div> 
  <ul>
   <li>We identify, quantify and enable economic and social opportunities in the digital economy to connect people to sources of income and service delivery. We work across the enablers required to scale these opportunities inclusively: digital and financial inclusion, digital upskilling and reskilling, inclusive tech-enabled business models, and policy and regulation.</li>
  </ul> 
  <ul>
   <li>We advise our clients on technology governance, policy, regulation, and ethics. We identify the biggest risks contributing to negative market, consumer and human rights outcomes as technology becomes mainstream. We advise on the best policy, regulatory and alternative approaches to managing these risks responsibly without stifling innovation.</li>
  </ul> 
  <ul>
   <li>We support data-driven decision making by employing a suite of tools that collect, analyse, and dynamically visualise the information required to make decisions more quickly and effectively across an organisation.</li>
  </ul> 
 </div> 
 <p><b>ROLE DESCRIPTION:</b></p> 
 <p> Are you passionate about leveraging technology and digitalization to drive economic and social development? Are you eager to work with private, public, and development clients to tackle complex challenges and make a lasting impact? If so, we have an incredible opportunity for you to join our dynamic team at the forefront of Africa's digital transformation!</p> 
 <p> As a Digital Economy Consultant, you will be working on cutting-edge projects that shape the future of technology-enabled growth across the African continent and Young World more broadly. You will collaborate with industry leaders, policymakers, and multilateral organizations to design, implement, and manage innovative solutions that address some of the most pressing development issues.</p> 
 <p> Examples of projects that you could work on include:</p> 
 <div> 
  <ul>
   <li>AI and Automation in Agri-Food Systems: Partner with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the US Agency for International Development to investigate how AI and automation can transform agri-food systems in low and middle-income countries. Unpack the risks, opportunities, and recommendations for steering AI innovation toward inclusive outcomes.</li>
