      </div>
      <div>
       <b>WHO WE ARE</b> 
       <p>We're an innovative technology company with strong ties to the financial industry. Innovating bank interoperability since 1972, supporting the growth of the South African Economy and individuals across the continent, is what we excel at. Continuously striving for financial inclusion and providing everyone with access to the digital economy enabling them to do more, get more and benefit from financial inclusion so that they can give more.</p>

       <p>The payments landscape is being modernised globally and, therefore, ours is an exciting industry to be part of. New technologies are the main thrust driving this change. Technology enables the possibilities, and people’s ingenuity creates opportunities.</p> 
      </div>
      <p>As an enabler our future plans are orchestrated around assembling a central payments environment that actively seeks and acquires strategic partners to enable service extensions. The core of our Financial Services Platform is a fully interoperable, cloud-ready composite platform delivering real-time value transfer and settlement, enhanced by a range of value-added services. The platform will leverage technological advancements aimed at: </p>
      <div>
       <ul>
        <li>Managing complex volumes</li>

        <li>Personalised user experiences, with standardised platform experiences being the norm</li>
       </ul> 
      </div>
      <div>
       <p>Doing more will be realised through our creation of platform extension partners who will benefit from our standardised API capability which they in turn can offer to their clients, giving more. We aim to include new Market Actors through our value chain extension which will allow 'pass-through' connection in those cases where an existing actor passes services through a new actor enabling them to give more to the ecosystem without compromising the security or the role of the heavily regulated financial institutions.</p>

 <p><b> Genesis Analytics </b><b>is a global advisory firm focussed on the developing world. </b>Genesis provides advice and solutions in fields of development and management consulting to multinational corporations, governments, international development agencies, and global foundations.</p> 
 <p><b> Genesis has offices in Johannesburg, London, Cape Town, Nairobi, Lagos, Abidjan and Addis Ababa. </b>Genesis has worked on more than 4,000 assignments in 96 countries.</p> 
 <p><b> Genesis’ purpose as a firm is to unlock value in the developing world.</b> Our 240+ consultants look at Africa and the developing world as an opportunity for massive positive social, economic and environmental progress. Our mission is to unlock that value, whether it is found in the private, social or public sector.</p> 
 <p><b> Genesis has practice areas in</b> strategy; climate change and just transition; ESG, shared value and impact; the digital economy; public health; behavioural economics; human development; competition and regulatory economics, monitoring, evaluation and learning; and youth economic opportunities.</p> 
 <p><b><i> About the Shared Value and Impact team:</i></b></p> 
 <p> You can find out more about the work of SVI by visiting our website and navigating to ""What we do"" and then ""Shared value and impact"".</p> 
 <p><b> The SVI team works where the private sector, government and society intersect.</b> While most development consultants focus on governments and donors only, and most management consultants focus on the private sector only, SVI intentionally advises both. We think of ourselves as management consultants working to improve development outcomes.</p> 
 <p><b> The purpose of the SVI practice is to reshape capitalism.</b><b> </b>We believe flourishing societies and healthy ecosystems should be the primary purpose of capitalism, not afterthoughts. We work in three ways to make this happen:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li><b>We advise multinational companies and global foundations </b>on ESG and impact strategy; climate change and the just transition; and bringing socio-economic and environmental impact into business strategy consciously. We also provide senior executives with public policy advice, political economy analysis, and political intelligence from across Africa.</li> 
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li><b>We advise governments </b>on development policy and strategy, climate change and the just transition, and the economic impact of new laws and policies.</li> 
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li><b>We facilitate dialogue initiatives and partnerships</b> <b>between the private and public actors </b>with our in-house partnering methodology called Joint Solutions.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p><b>All of our work is interesting, intellectually diverse and meaningful.</b> It makes a difference to peoples’ lives.</p> 
 <p><b> We work in a flat culture </b>that values sustainable hours, flexible working, and high financial reward. We support every team member with personal development to build a successful career in a high-performance environment.</p> 
 <p><b> The growth of SVI requires a Senior Associate to join the team.</b></p>

  <p>We believe in a world where growth thrives across borders and cultures. That's why our Founder and CEO Rick Hammell started Atlas, coining the term Employer of Record (EOR) simultaneously. As an EOR, Atlas employs people to work for companies anywhere in the world. Before we came along, the only businesses offering a similar solution were essentially brokers. They'd outsource your HR and payroll services to third-party providers in different countries. Today, we're the only 100% Direct EOR in the world, partnering with clients to get to market 82% faster, at a reduced cost, and with lower risk through local expertise in over 160 countries.</p>
  <br> 
  <p></p> 
  <p> Atlas technology powers the idea that companies can employ whoever they want, wherever they are in the world. Through our cloud-based platform, we deliver the Human Resources infrastructure that underpins international growth, leaving companies free to focus on the strategy that makes it happen. We partner with our clients through their international life cycle from the first dip in the global pool until the moment it's time to set up their own entities and run payroll. Atlas is here from point A to point Z.</p>
  <br> 
  <p></p>

       <p>We provide skills, development opportunities and leadership support to our people so that they can hone their skills to do more and give more in support of each other, our clients, and our communities in a supportive, yet performance driven, environment.</p> 
      </div>
      <div>
       <b>WHO WE ARE</b> 
       <p>We're an innovative technology company with strong ties to the financial industry. Innovating bank interoperability since 1972, supporting the growth of the South African Economy and individuals across the continent, is what we excel at. Continuously striving for financial inclusion and providing everyone with access to the digital economy enabling them to do more, get more and benefit from financial inclusion so that they can give more.</p> 
      </div>

      </div>
      <div>
       <b>WHERE WE'RE GOING</b>

      </div>
      <p>As an enabler our future plans are orchestrated around assembling a central payments environment that actively seeks and acquires strategic partners to enable service extensions. The core of our Financial Services Platform is a fully interoperable, cloud-ready composite platform delivering real-time value transfer and settlement, enhanced by a range of value-added services.

      </div>

       <p>Doing more will be realised through our creation of platform extension partners who will benefit from our standardised API capability which they in turn can offer to their clients, giving more. We aim to include new Market Actors through our value chain extension which will allow 'pass-through' connection in those cases where an existing actor passes services through a new actor enabling them to give more to the ecosystem without compromising the security or the role of the heavily regulated financial institutions.</p>
