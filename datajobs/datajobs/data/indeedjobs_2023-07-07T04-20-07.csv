         <p>The digital age is bringing rapid change. Businesses are becoming increasingly interconnected, and borders around supply/value chains are becoming increasingly blurred. At PwC, we recognise the importance of technology risk services as a key enabler in organisations. You’ll work closely with IT, the business, and the audit and risk functions to align business processes and risk to the business environment through identifying risks and recommending mitigation controls. We offer a three-year contract, on-site training and valuable work experience. We’re looking for talented, skilled graduates who can bring new ideas and a fresh approach to Risk Services .</p>
         <p><br> In Data and Analytics we help our clients analyse big and complex data sets by linking performance and decision making with data and technology. This could mean driving new growth opportunities, operating more efficiently or identifying and managing risk. Data and analytics are revolutionising business, underpinning decision making and driving innovation. But greater volumes and more detailed data bring new challenges for businesses in converting that data into a more comprehensible and user-friendly format — creating actionable insights and applying these to transform an organisation.</p>
